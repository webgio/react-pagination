# React pagination

Looking at https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/pagination I wonder what it be like to develop something similar with React. I currently invested 1 full day on react study and playing.

## Development

watchify --debug -t reactify main.jsx -o main.js
